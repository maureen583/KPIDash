## Employees Seed Data

Generate 30 fake employees using Bogus with these roles:

- 10 General Operator
- 6 Mixers
- 6 Mill Man
- 4 Supervisor
- 4 Maintenance

---

## TimeLog Rules

- Generate 7 days of shift history (inclusive of today up to `DateTime.UtcNow`)
- Three shifts per day: Day (06:00-14:00), Afternoon (14:00-22:00), Night (22:00-06:00)
- Operators are assigned **per line** — each TimeLog row has a `Line` value ('Line 1' or 'Line 2')
- Planned staffing per line per shift:

| Shift     | Line 1 | Line 2 | Total |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Day       | 6      | 4      | 10    |
| Afternoon | 4      | 4      | 8     |
| Night     | 4      | 2      | 6     |

- Actual counts vary at or below planned (never exceed planned — range is 0 to -1 from planned)
- ClockIn/ClockOut should have small random variance (±15 min) from shift start/end
- ShiftDate is always the date the shift STARTED

---

## ProductionSchedule Rules

Each shift on each line is divided into 2–3 consecutive compound runs. Every run gets its own row — the schedule is fully chronological with no gaps on Day and Afternoon shifts, and a 2-hour unscheduled window at the end of Night shifts.

### Schema

| Column           | Type    | Notes                                              |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ScheduleId       | INTEGER | PK AUTOINCREMENT                                   |
| ShiftDate        | TEXT    | YYYY-MM-DD — date the shift **started**            |
| Shift            | TEXT    | Day \| Afternoon \| Night                          |
| Line             | TEXT    | 'Line 1' \| 'Line 2'                               |
| CompoundCode     | TEXT    | e.g. 'NR-100'                                      |
| CompoundName     | TEXT    | e.g. 'Natural Rubber Base'                         |
| ScheduledStart   | TEXT    | ISO datetime — start of this compound run          |
| ScheduledEnd     | TEXT    | ISO datetime — end of this compound run            |
| TargetBatches    | INTEGER | duration\_minutes / 10 (avg cycle time), rounded   |
| PlannedOperators | INTEGER | Planned headcount for the full shift               |

### Compound library (rotate through these)

| CompoundCode | CompoundName              |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| NR-100       | Natural Rubber Base       |
| SBR-200      | Styrene Butadiene General |
| EPDM-300     | EPDM Weather Seal         |
| NBR-400      | Nitrile Oil Resistant     |
| CR-500       | Chloroprene Adhesive      |
| BR-600       | Butadiene High Resilience |

### Shift capacity rules

| Shift     | Shift window    | Scheduled production | Unscheduled |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Day       | 06:00 – 14:00   | 06:00 – 14:00 (8 h)  | none        |
| Afternoon | 14:00 – 22:00   | 14:00 – 22:00 (8 h)  | none        |
| Night     | 22:00 – 06:00   | 22:00 – 04:00 (6 h)  | 04:00–06:00 |

- Day and Afternoon shifts are scheduled to 100% capacity — compound runs fill the full 8 hours with no gaps
- Night shift schedules 6 of 8 hours — the last 2 hours (04:00–06:00) are unscheduled (no rows)
- Generate 2 or 3 compound runs per shift per line (randomise; do not always split evenly)
- Run durations must sum exactly to the scheduled window
- Example 3-run Day split: 2.5 h / 3 h / 2.5 h → TargetBatches: 15 / 18 / 15
- Do not repeat the same compound consecutively on the same line within a shift

### TargetBatches calculation

`TargetBatches = ROUND(duration_minutes / 10)`

Average cycle time is 10 minutes (midpoint of the 8–12 min Banbury cycle).

### PlannedOperators per line per shift

`PlannedOperators` is set **per line** on each ProductionSchedule row:

| Shift     | Line 1 | Line 2 |
| --------- | ------ | ------ |
| Day       | 6      | 4      |
| Afternoon | 4      | 4      |
| Night     | 4      | 2      |

All compound-run rows for the same line+shift share the same PlannedOperators value.

---

## Batch Rules

- One batch takes 8-12 minutes in the Banbury
- Batches are placed **consecutively** — Batch N+1 StartedAt = Batch N CompletedAt (no idle gap between batch records)
- Only active Down periods interrupt the sequence; the seeder skips past downtime and resumes consecutive placement after recovery
- This means actual batch count ≈ TargetBatches when running cleanly; slightly over if cycles are short (8 min); slightly under proportional to downtime duration
- BatchNumber format: `B-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (e.g. `B-20260101-001`)
- TargetDumpTemp is always 120.0C
- DumpTemperature should be TargetDumpTemp ± 15C with normal distribution
- ~5% of batches should have Status = Rejected (DumpTemp out of range by >10C)
- ~2% of batches should have Status = InProgress (most recent batch of current shift)
- All others Status = Complete
- Each batch is assigned to one Operator from the active shift
- Each batch must have a `Line` value ('Line 1' or 'Line 2') — split roughly 50/50 per shift
- Each batch must have a `CompoundCode` taken from the ProductionSchedule run whose ScheduledStart–ScheduledEnd window the batch falls within
- Night shift batches running between 00:00–05:59 are attributed to the previous calendar day's Night shift (the date the shift started)

---

## SensorReadings Rules

- Generate one reading per sensor every 5 minutes for 7 days
- Values must reflect the equipment's current state (Running, Idle, or Down)
- State transitions should be realistic — equipment doesn't flip state every reading
- equipment states need to make sense, if conveyor is down, equipment below it should stop within
  5 minutes and stay stopped for 5 minutes until it restarts. Follow equipment order for this pattern
- states should change at least once for at least 5 minutes per 4 hour window

### Value ranges by state:

**Running** — values within MinNormal to MaxNormal with small Gaussian noise (±3%)

**Idle** — motor/speed sensors drop to 0, temperature sensors drift slowly within range

- RPM sensors: 0
- Current sensors: 0-2A (residual)
- Temperature sensors: slowly drift toward ambient (20C) but stay in range
- Pressure sensors: drop to minimum or 0

**Down** — one or more sensors drift outside normal range

- The triggering sensor drifts beyond MinNormal or MaxNormal
- Other sensors follow suit over 2-5 readings (realistic degradation)
- Down periods last 15-60 minutes

---

## EquipmentStatus Rules

- Derived from SensorReadings — do not generate independently
- One status record per state change (not one per reading)
- Status transitions: Running → Idle → Running is normal between batches
- Status transitions: Running → Down or Idle → Down indicates a fault
- Reason mapping:
  - Running + all sensors normal = `NormalOperation`
  - Idle + all sensors healthy = `Idle`
  - Down + motor fault = `FaultTrip`
  - Down + temp out of range = `ParameterOutOfRange`
  - Down + instantaneous drop = `EmergencyStop`

---

## DowntimeEvents Rules

- Derived from EquipmentStatus — do not generate independently
  Use these exact string values for the Reason field in both DowntimeEvents and EquipmentStatus:

| Reason            | Category   | Trigger                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BearingFailure`  | Mechanical | RPM drops while current spikes                          |
| `HydraulicLeak`   | Mechanical | HydraulicPressure drops out of range                    |
| `DriveFailure`    | Mechanical | RPM drops to 0 while current remains high               |
| `MotorOverload`   | Electrical | MotorCurrent spikes beyond MaxNormal                    |
| `PowerOutage`     | Electrical | All sensors drop to 0 simultaneously                    |
| `RubberStick`     | Process    | MotorCurrent spikes, RPM drops                          |
| `TempOutOfRange`  | Process    | Chamber/roll temp drifts beyond MinNormal or MaxNormal  |
| `CoolingFailure`  | Process    | WaterFlowRate drops below MinNormal                     |
| `EmergencyStop`   | Safety     | All motor sensors drop to 0 instantaneously (1 reading) |
| `SafetyGuardOpen` | Safety     | All motor sensors drop to 0 instantaneously (1 reading) |

- One row per continuous Down period per equipment
- StartedAt = timestamp of first Down status record
- EndedAt = timestamp of first non-Down status after recovery (NULL if still down)
- DurationMinutes = calculated from StartedAt and EndedAt
- Reason matches the EquipmentStatus Reason that triggered it
- Target: 1 downtime event per shift per equipment (~21 over 7 days per equipment)

---

## Realistic State Schedule (per day per equipment)

A typical 24-hour period should look roughly like:

```
06:00 - Running (Day shift starts, equipment warming up)
06:00 - 14:00 — Running with brief Idle gaps (1-2 min) between batches, 1 Down event per shift (15-60 min)
14:00 - 22:00 — Same pattern as Day shift
22:00 - 06:00 — Same pattern as Night shift
```

Each shift (Day, Afternoon, Night) on each line always has exactly 1 downtime event.
Inter-batch idle windows are short: 1–2 minutes between each 8–12 min run cycle (~10–15% idle).

---

## Key Constraints

- SensorReadings and EquipmentStatus must be internally consistent
  (a Down status must have at least one out-of-range sensor reading)
- Batches are placed consecutively through scheduled production time; only Down periods on the Banbury create gaps in the batch sequence
- Batch StartedAt must fall within a ProductionSchedule ScheduledStart–ScheduledEnd window
  for the matching Line; batches must not be generated during unscheduled time (04:00–06:00 Night)
- TimeLog shift coverage must overlap with batch production times. Certain shifts should have more people on than others so we can show variance in calculations for Utilization
- DowntimeEvents must not overlap for the same equipment
- Actual operators clocked in for a shift never exceed the PlannedOperators count for that shift
- Labour efficiency is capped at 100% in the KPI formula — values above 1.0 are floored to 1.0
